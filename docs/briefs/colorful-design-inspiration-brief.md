# Flow State Fishing: Colorful Design Inspiration Brief

## Problem & User Impact

- Current fishing website themes rely on muted, traditional color palettes (browns, grays, blues) that fail to capture the vibrant energy and excitement of flow state experiences
- Static, conservative designs don't reflect the dynamic, engaging nature of modern fishing enthusiasts who seek adventure and community
- Lack of energetic visual identity reduces user engagement and time-on-site compared to vibrant, personality-driven blogs in other verticals
- Typography choices in existing fishing themes often use outdated, heavy serif fonts that feel antiquated rather than contemporary and inspiring
- Missing opportunity to differentiate from standard fishing content through bold, memorable visual branding that attracts younger demographics

## Constraints

**Performance**: Maintain under 3-second load times with colorful graphics and custom typography on mobile devices used in remote fishing locations

**Accessibility**: All color combinations must meet WCAG 4.5:1 contrast ratios for text readability

**Platform**: Support Ghost theme architecture while integrating modern CSS custom properties and responsive design

**Brand Consistency**: Preserve existing fish logo identity while expanding color palette harmoniously

## Source of Truth

**Existing Brand Assets**:
- Fish logo SVG: `/assets/images/logo.svg` with primary green #5DA477 and coral accent #F57483
- Current color system: `/assets/css/vars.css`
- Typography foundation: `/assets/css/components/typography.css`

**2024 Design Trends**:
- Pantone Color of Year: Peach Fuzz (soft, warm accent)
- Benjamin Moore: Blue Nova 825 (deep blue direction)
- Vibrant color trend shift from neutral minimalism to expressive, personality-driven palettes

## Canonical Interfaces

**Current**: Basic Ghost template structure with limited color variables and standard font stacks

**Intended**:
- Extended color palette with primary green #5DA477, coral #F57483, and 4-6 complementary colors
- Typography system: Display font (Bebas Neue/Montserrat) + body font (Nunito/Open Sans)
- CSS custom properties for dynamic color theming
- Responsive grid layouts with colorful card components

## Risks & Unknowns

- Risk: Vibrant colors may alienate traditional fishing audience | Verify: A/B test color intensity with user feedback surveys
- Risk: Font licensing costs for premium typography | Verify: Evaluate Google Fonts alternatives vs. purchased licenses
- Risk: Color accessibility compliance with bright palettes | Verify: Audit all combinations with contrast checking tools
- Risk: Performance impact of custom fonts and graphics | Verify: Test loading speeds across device spectrum
